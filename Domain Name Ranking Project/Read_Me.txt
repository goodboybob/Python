This code is basically to rank the domain Names which are available for sale.

Some domain names like  "hey-lets-go-to-vegas-and-have-fun.com" are useless compared to domain names like "Vegastrip.com"

So, I have developed an algorithm which ranks the various domain names. 

INPUT

1. A file containing a list of domain names - without the .com , .net part (name is hardcoded to domains_dos.txt)

2. An english dictionary in a list form (name is hardcoded to words.txt)

You can see the outputs stored in an excel file - Domain Rank.xlsx
